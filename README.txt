The Rshiny has the details about the project in the Introduction section. 
It contains results for canalization for 153 environmental expsorues and 9 complex traits of the UK Biobank at:
- PRS p < 5e-08
- PRS p < 1e-03

By clicking on Yes/No on the table, you can view the plots for each environmental exposure and trait
- A. Prevalence vs percentile PRS plots divided by high and low exposure groups
- B. High minus low (H_L) curves
- C. H-L curves mean centered
- D. Derivative distribution of cubic curves for real data and random iterations.
